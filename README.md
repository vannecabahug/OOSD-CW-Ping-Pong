# OOSD-CW-Ping-Pong
A scoresheet for Ping Pong teams and players - made using Java on NetBeans IDE


The source package contains several java and FXML files, the main class file is named OOSD2Coursework.java
Running the program will display an interactive GUI which the user can access many functions to work and calculate the scoresheet.
There are 3 interfaces of the GUI listed at the bottom of the program, the 3 tabs being ***'Administration' 'Scoresheet' 'Results'***

Firstly, teams will need to be added under the ***Create a New Team*** input box, following the addition of players to their respective teams using the dropdown menu.

***Generate Fixtures*** will create a match between two teams to enter onto the scoreboard. This fixture can be seen in ***Results*** > ***Fixtures and Results***.
A minimum of ***TWO*** teams will need to be created for this to work.

We initialise a scoresheet by clicking on ***New Scoresheet*** which then allows you to choose teams, select players and enter scores.
Matches are played to 11 points so a score would look something like 11:5 / 3:11 / 10:11 / 11:1 etc.
